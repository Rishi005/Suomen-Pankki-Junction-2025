In accordance with chapter 18, section 6 of the Credit Institutions Act, chapter 15, section 11 b of said Act applies to branches of foreign credit institutions and foreign credit institutions providing services in Finland based on the freedom of provision of services.",
      "Performance Measurement: (3) Supervised entities shall measure the performance of the operating model of the rating system in the assessment of default risks on the credit granting date using the Gini coefficient.\n\n(4) Supervised entities shall calculate the Gini coefficient using the methodology described in paragraphs (9)-(13) with an example calculation. Supervised entities must calculate the Gini coefficient using a comparable method in connection with MK reporting in accordance with section 4.5",

However, the information shall be provided regularly, at least on an annual basis, and whenever separately required by the FIN-FSA.",
      "MK reporting: (26) Supervised entities must submit the MK report to the FIN-FSA in accordance with the reporting map for the financial sector1. Reporting is made for reporter levels 201, 205, 210, 214, 218, 221, 222, 260, and 227.\n\n(27) A supervised entity that is the parent company of a consolidation group must report the data at the level of the consolidation group (reporter level 205 or 214). The reporting obligation does not apply to the parent companies of sub-consolidation groups. Other supervised entities belonging to the consolidation group are not required to report the data.\n\n(28) If a supervised entity does not belong to a consolidation group, it must report the data at the solo level (reporter level 201 or 210).\n\n(29) The central institution of an amalgamation of deposit banks must report the data at the level of the amalgamation (reporter level 260). Other supervised entities within the amalgamation are not required to report the data.\n\n(30) Branches of foreign credit institutions pursuing credit institution activities in Finland must report the data at the solo level (reporter level 221 or 222).\n\n(31) The reporting concerns unsecured consumer credits falling within the scope of application of chapter 7 of the Consumer Protection Act. Hire purchase credits with a reservation of title condition are excluded from the scope of the reporting. The reporting is submitted once a year on a product-specific basis. If a single product has several applicable models, these are reported by model.\n\n(32) The reference date in the MK template is the last day (31th) of December. The reference period is a one- year period 1-2 years prior to the reference date. In other words, in the first reporting cycle, for the reference date 31 December 2025, reporting concerns all new credits granted between 1 January and 31 December 2024. The purpose of the reporting is to review credits granted during a year, over a review period of 1-2 years. For credits granted on 1 January, the review period is almost 24 months, and for credits granted on 31 December, it is 12 months. Applications to raise a credit limit or amount of credit are excluded from the reporting.\n\n(33) Reportable credits are divided across the rows of the MK template into 20 buckets as equal in size as possible. Each bucket contains approximately 5% all credits granted in terms of the number of credits.\n\n(34) The data to be reported in the columns of the MK template are: Not past due or past due <= 30 days, count; Not past due or past due <= 30 days, \u20ac; Past due > 30 days and <= 90 days, count; Past due > 30 days and <= 90 days, \u20ac; Past due > 90 days, count; Past due > 90 days, \u20ac; Repaid credits, count; Realised credit losses, count and Realised credit losses, \u20ac. Realised credit losses also include information on potentially sold credit portfolios to the extent that write-offs have been made, and on credits that have been terminated before falling more than 90 days past due and without being recognised as impaired. Reporting is made at the contract level.\n\n(35) Supervised entities falling within the scope of application of FIN-FSA regulations and guidelines 20/2013 (supervised entities and foreign branches referred to in the FIN-FSA Act (878/2008)) shall report data on assets past due and not past due using the instructions concerning FINREP template F 18.00 provided in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 451/2021 with respect to the threshold values of the significance of the asset and its level of classification (by transaction, by debtor).\n\n(36) The supervised entity shall report the Gini coefficient of the product on the MK form in accordance with paragraph (13).\n\n(37) The supervised entity shall report the proportion of bad credits in the highest 5% risk bucket relative to all credits in that bucket in accordance with paragraph (22).",
      "Permission to deviate from the MK reporting obligation: (39)The FIN-FSA may, on an application by the supervised entity, grant a fixed-term exemption from the minimum number of reportable risk buckets under paragraph (33) if:\n\u00b7 The supervised entity has demonstrated that compliance with the requirement for the minimum number of reportable risk buckets would cause a significant operational detriment and has presented a credible plan to align its activities with these requirements within a reasonable period of time; or\n\u00b7 Lending by the supervised entity is sufficiently limited in extent and nature to justify a reduction in the number of reportable buckets; or\n. The supervised entity has another justified reason to deviate from the requirement for the minimum number of reportable buckets.\nIn general, exemptions from the minimum number of risk buckets to be reported shall be granted only in exceptional circumstances and must not compromise the objectives of regulation on risk ratings.",
      "Exemption application: (40) A supervised entity shall submit a written application to the FIN-FSA if it requests an exemption from the number of risk buckets to be reported under paragraph (33).\n\n(41) The supervised entity shall notify the FIN-FSA in writing without undue delay if there is a change in the conditions on which an exemption was granted."

      "Date of application: These guidelines apply from 30 June 2019.",

      "NPE strategy: In the development and implementation of their NPE strategies, credit institutions should take into account relevant consumer protection considerations and requirements, and ensure fair treatment of consumers.",
      "Developing the NPE strategy: Credit institutions should establish an NPE strategy to target a time-bound reduction of NPEs over a realistic but sufficiently ambitious time horizon (NPE reduction targets). The NPE strategy should lay out the credit institution's approach and objectives regarding effective management to maximise recoveries and ultimately a reduction in NPE stocks in a clear, credible and feasible manner for each relevant portfolio. When developing and implementing the NPE strategy for retail portfolios, credit institutions should consider provisions aimed at protecting consumers, including Directive 2014/17/EU, 13 Directive 2008/48/EC14 and the EBA Guidelines on arrears and foreclosure.15",
      "Assessing the operating environment: As a first phase in the formulation and execution of an appropriate NPE strategy, credit institutions should complete an assessment of the following elements:\na) internal capabilities to effectively manage and reduce NPEs;\nb) external conditions and operating environment;\nc) the capital implications of the NPE strategy.",

      "Internal capabilities/self-assessment: Credit institutions should report the outcome of the comprehensive self-assessment to the institution's management body and the competent authority.",
      "Internal capabilities/self-assessment: Credit institutions should consider seeking expert views on their operational capabilities to manage NPEs from the institution's risk management and control functions or from external sources on a periodic basis.",
      "External conditions and operating environment: Credit institutions should assess and consider the current and likely future external operating conditions and environment when establishing the NPE strategy and associated NPE reduction targets. The following list of external factors, where appropriate, should be taken into account by credit institutions when setting the NPE strategy:\na) The macroeconomic conditions, including the dynamics of the real estate market or other relevant sectors, taking into account sector concentrations in NPE portfolios.",
      "External conditions and operating environment: NPE investor demand, including trends in and the dynamics of the domestic and international NPE markets for portfolio sales.\nd) The maturity of the NPE servicing industry and the availability and coverage of specialised servicers.\ne) The regulatory, legal and judicial framework. Credit institutions should have a good understanding of the legal proceedings related to NPE workout for different types of assets and different jurisdictions. In particular, credit institutions should assess the average duration of such proceedings, the average financial outcomes, the rankings of different types of exposures and related implications for outcomes, the influence of the types and rankings of collateral and guarantees on the outcomes, the impact of consumer protection issues on legal decisions, and the average total costs associated with legal proceedings. Legal provisions aimed at protecting consumers, in particular for residential mortgage exposures, should also be considered by credit institutions when setting the NPE strategy.\nf) The national tax implications of impairments and NPE write-offs.",
      "Capital implications of the NPE strategy: Credit institutions should be able to calculate a detailed assessment of the impact of the planned strategy from capital, risk exposure amount, profit or loss, and impairment perspectives for each of the reduction drivers, and they should assess whether the bank has identified a strategic process to resolve any shortfalls under different economic scenarios. The assessment criteria, underlying assumptions and implications should be aligned with the RAF as well as with the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP).16",
      "Capital implications of the NPE strategy: Credit institutions should include suitable actions in their capital planning to ensure that the level of available capital will enable a sustainable reduction of NPEs on the balance sheet.",
      "Development of the NPE strategy: The NPE strategy should encompass, at a minimum, time-bound quantitative NPE targets and foreclosed assets targets, supported, where appropriate, by a corresponding comprehensive operational plan. The development of the NPE strategy should be informed by a self- assessment process and an analysis of the strategic options for the implementation of the NPE strategy. The NPE strategy and operational plan should be defined and approved by the management body and reviewed at least annually.",
      "Strategy implementation options: Credit institutions should consider including a combination of strategies and options in the NPE strategy to achieve their objectives over the short, medium and long term. In order to successfully operationalise the NPE strategy, credit institutions should consider at least the following non-mutually exclusive implementation options for different portfolios and under different conditions:\na) Hold/forbearance strategy: suitable workout strategy and forbearance options. The hold strategy option is strongly linked to the credit institution's operating model, forbearance and borrower assessment expertise, operational NPE management capabilities, outsourcing of servicing and write-off policies.\nb) Active portfolio reductions: sales, securitisation or, in the case of NPEs that are deemed unrecoverable, write-offs. This option is strongly linked to adequacy of impairments, collateral valuations, quality of exposure data and investors' demand for NPEs.\nc) Change of type of exposure or collateral, including foreclosure, debt to equity swapping, debt to asset swapping or collateral substitution.\nd) Legal options: including insolvency proceedings or out-of-court solutions.",
      "Strategy implementation options: Credit institutions should identify medium- and long-term strategy options for NPE reductions that may not be achievable immediately, for example due to a lack of immediate NPE investor demand, which might change in the medium to long term. The operational plan may therefore need to allow for such changes and require preparations for them, for example by enhancing the quality of NPE data in order to be ready for future investor transactions.",
      "Strategy implementation options: When a credit institution concludes that none of the above options will lead to a sufficient NPE reduction in the medium to long term for certain portfolios or individual exposures, this should be clearly reflected in a timely impairment and write-off approach.",
      "Strategy implementation options: Credit institutions aiming to engage in complex processes, such as NPE risk transfer and securitisation transactions, should conduct robust risk analysis and have adequate risk control processes in place.17",
      "Targets: Before commencing the short- to medium-term target-setting process, credit institutions should establish a view of reasonable targets given current and likely external conditions. The NPE strategy and operational plan should include appropriate key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure progress towards the stated targets. As part of the planning process, credit institutions should prepare projections of relevant financial metrics based on the NPE strategy implementation, taking into account the implications for profitability, capital, risk exposure amounts and funding."

Category A: MoC related to data and methodological deficiencies identified under Category A as referred to in paragraph 36(a) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation;\nii. Category B: MoC related to relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk appetite, collection and recovery policies and any other source of additional uncertainty identified under Category B as referred to in paragraph 36(b) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation; and\niii. Category C: MoC related to the general estimation error.",
      "Downturn LGD estimation: Institutions need to estimate downturn LGDs appropriate to each downturn period identified in accordance with the RTS on economic downturn. As the approach in the RTS can lead to the identification of multiple downturn periods, institutions need to calibrate downturn LGD and provide the resulting LGD downturn estimates in relation to different downturn periods.",
      "conservative downturn LGD: The GL clarify how this requirement should be interpreted in the context of calibration of downturn LGD. It should be noted, however, that this requirement to compare downturn and long-run average LGD used for calibration is without prejudice to the requirement in Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR to ensure that the actual downturn LGD estimates are used (in application) if they are more conservative than long-run average LGDs",

      "Suitability Assessment: These Guidelines specify further, in accordance with Article 91(12) of Directive 2013/36/EU12 and Article 9(1) second subparagraph of Directive 2014/65/EU13, the requirements regarding the suitability of members of the management body in particular, the notions of sufficient time commitment; honesty, integrity and independence of mind of a member of the management body; adequate collective knowledge, skills and experience of the management body; and adequate human and financial resources devoted to the induction and training of such members. The notion of diversity to be taken into account for the selection of members of the management body is also specified in accordance with the above-mentioned articles.",
      "Suitability Assessment: The Guidelines also specify elements regarding the suitability of the heads of internal control functions and the chief financial officer (CFO), where they are not part of the management body, and, where identified on a risk-based approach by those institutions, of other key function holders, as part of the governance arrangements referred to in Article 9(3) and Article 16(2) of Directive 2014/65/EU and in Article 74(1) and Article 91(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU. This means, among other things, that institutions are expected to determine on a risk-based approach which other key function holders have a significant influence over the direction of the institution under the overall responsibility of the management body, in accordance with Principle 10.",
      "Institutions Assessment: Institutions are primarily responsible for ensuring that members of the management body fulfil the suitability criteria as defined in the Guidelines on an ongoing basis, and need to establish appropriate policies and procedures for this purpose. The nomination committee required for significant CRD institutions has a key role in assessing the suitability, diversity and composition of the management body. Where no nomination committee is established, the management body in its supervisory function as part of the institution's governance arrangements is responsible for fulfilling the tasks that are normally performed by the nomination committee, to ensure the effective and prudent management of the institution and the effectiveness of the institution's governance arrangements.",
      "Institutions Assessment: Institutions should assess the suitability of proposed members and members of the management body prior to their appointment or when duly justified as soon as practicable, but in any case within one month of the appointment, and should inform the competent authority of the proposed appointment or without delay after the appointment. Indeed, where shareholders nominate and appoint members of the management body at the general assembly, a prior assessment may not always be possible."

      "IRRBB: Institutions should consider all interest rate sensitive instruments in the banking book in the context of the assessment and management of exposures to IRRBB, including assets, liabilities, interest rate derivatives, non-interest rate derivatives referencing an interest rate and other off-balance sheet items (such as loan commitments).",
      "IRRBB: Institutions should consider non-performing exposures12 (net of provisions) as interest rate sensitive instruments reflecting expected cash flows and their timing.",
      "IRRBB: When evaluating the amounts, types and distributions of internal capital pursuant to Article 73 of Directive 2013/36/EU, institutions should base the contribution of IRRBB to the overall internal capital assessment on the institution's internal measurement systems outputs, taking account of key assumptions and risk limits. The overall level of capital should be commensurate with both the institution's actual measured level of risk (including for IRRBB) and its risk appetite, and be duly documented in its report on the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP report).",
      "IRRBB: Institutions should demonstrate that their internal capital is commensurate with the level of IRRBB, taking into account the impact on internal capital of potential changes in the institution's economic value and future net interest income measures plus market value changes resulting from changes in interest rates. Institutions should evaluate IRRBB risk measures in their internal capital determination particularly noting that the IRRBB measures capture the risk in a complementary manner (e.g., considering IRRBB from a different time horizon). Institutions are not expected to double-count their internal capital for EV and net interest income measures plus market value changes, nonetheless the internal capital allocation methodology should consider both IRRBB risk measures and explicitly assess their potential impact on internal capital.",
      "IRRBB: In their ICAAP analysis of the amount of internal capital required for IRRBB, institutions should consider:\n(a) internal capital held for risks to economic value that could arise from adverse movements in interest rates; and\n(b) internal capital needs arising from the impact of rate changes on future net interest income plus market value changes capacity, and the resultant implications for internal capital buffer levels.",
      "IRRBB: Institutions should not only rely on the supervisory assessments of capital adequacy for IRRBB or on the outcome of the supervisory outlier test, but should develop and use their own methodologies for capital allocation, based on their risk appetite, level of risk and risk management policies. In determining the appropriate level of capital, institutions should consider both the amount and the quality of capital needed.",
      "IRRBB: Capital adequacy assessments for IRRBB should take into account the following:\n(a) the size and tenor of internal limits on IRRBB exposures, and whether or not these limits are reached at the point of capital calculation;\n(b) the expected cost of hedging open positions that are intended to take advantage of internal expectations of the future level of interest rates;\n(c) the sensitivity of the internal measures of IRRBB to key or imperfect modelling assumptions;\n(d) the impact of shock and stress scenarios on positions priced with different interest rate indices (basis risk);\n(e) the impact on economic value and net interest income plus market value changes of mismatched positions in different currencies;\n(f) the impact of embedded losses and embedded gains;\n(g) the distribution of capital relative to risks across legal entities included in the group's prudential perimeter of consolidation, in addition to the adequacy of overall capital on a consolidated basis;\n(h) the drivers of the underlying risk; and\n(i) the circumstances under which the risk may materialise.",
      "IRRBB: The outcomes of the capital adequacy for IRRBB should be considered in an institution's ICAAP and flow through to the assessments of capital associated with business lines.",
      "IRRBB: To calibrate the amount of internal capital to be held for IRRBB, institutions should use measurement systems and a range of interest rate shock and stress scenarios, which are adapted to the risk profile of the institution in order to quantify the potential scale of any IRRBB effects under adverse conditions.",
      "IRRBB: Institutions that operate internal capital models should ensure that the internal capital allocation for IRRBB is properly factored into the overall internal capital allocation and that any assumptions on diversification are documented and their reliability as well as stability is verified using historical data appropriate for the individual institution and the markets in which it operates. Internal capital costs may be allocated back to the business units and products to ensure that the full costs of the underlying business units or products are properly understood by those responsible for managing them.",
      "IRRBB: In considering whether or not an allocation of internal capital should be made in respect of IRRBB to net interest income measures plus market value changes, institutions should take into account the following:\n(a) The relative importance of net interest income to total net income, and therefore the impact of significant variations in net interest income from year to year;\n(b) The actual levels of net interest income achievable under different scenarios (i.e., the extent to which margins are wide enough to absorb volatility arising from interest rate positions and changes in the cost of liabilities);\n(c) The potential for actual losses to be incurred under stressed conditions, or as a result of secular changes in the market environment - e.g., where it might become necessary to liquidate positions that are intended as a long-term investment to stabilise net interest income measures plus market value changes;\n(d) The relative importance of interest rate sensitive instruments (including interest rate derivatives) in the non-trading book, with potential effects shown either in the profit and loss account or directly in equity (e.g., via other comprehensive income); and\n(e) The fluctuation of net interest income measures plus market value changes, the strength and stability of the net interest income measures plus market value changes streams and the level of income needed to generate and maintain normal business operations. Institutions with a high level of IRRBB that could, under a plausible range of market scenarios, result in losses, in curtailing normal dividend distribution, or in a decrease in business operations should ensure that they have sufficient capital to withstand the adverse impact of these scenarios.",
      "IRRBB: Institutions should consider internal capital buffer adjustments where the results of their stress testing highlight the potential for reduced net interest income measures plus market value changes (and therefore reduced capital generation capacity) under stress scenarios.",
      "IRRBB: The IRRBB strategy of the institution, including the risk appetite for IRRBB and IRRBB mitigation, should be part of the overall strategy, in particular the strategic objectives and risk objectives, which the management body must approve as laid down in subparagraph (2), letter (a) of Article 88(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU.",
      "IRRBB: The institution's risk appetite for IRRBB should be expressed in terms of the acceptable impact of fluctuating interest rates on both IRRBB measures should be reflected in limits. Institutions with significant exposures to gap risk, basis risk or option risk should determine their risk appetite in relation to each of these material sub-types of IRRBB.",
      "IRRBB: The overall IRRBB strategy should also include the decision about the extent to which the business model relies on generating net interest income by 'riding the yield curve' - i.e., funding assets with a comparatively long repricing period with liabilities with a comparatively short repricing period. Where the business model relies heavily on this source of net interest income, the management body should explain its IRRBB strategy and how it plans to survive periods of flat or inverse yield curves.",
      "IRRBB: Institutions should duly assess proposals to use new products, or engage in new activities, risk- taking or hedging strategies, prior to acquisition or implementation to ensure that the resources required to establish sound and effective IRRBB management of the product or activity have been identified, that the proposed activities are in line with the institution's overall risk appetite, and that procedures to identify, measure, monitor and control the risks of the proposed product or activity have been established. It should be ensured that the IRRBB characteristics of these new products and activities are well understood.",
      "IRRBB: Institutions using derivative instruments to mitigate IRRBB exposures should possess the necessary knowledge and expertise. Each institution should demonstrate that it understands the consequences of hedging with interest rate derivatives.",
      "IRRBB: Institutions using models of customer behaviour as input for the measurement of their IRRBB should possess the necessary knowledge and expertise. Each institution should be able to demonstrate that it understands the consequences of modelling the behaviour of its customer base.",
      "IRRBB: When making decisions on hedging activities, institutions should be aware of the effects of accounting policies, but the accounting treatment should not drive their risk management approach.",
      "IRRBB: Consolidating institutions should ensure that internal governance arrangements and processes for the management of IRRBB are consistent and well integrated on a consolidated and a sub- consolidated basis.",
      "IRRBB: In view of having internal governance arrangements pursuant to Article 74 and 88 of Directive 2013/36/EU, institutions should, in relation to IRRBB, ensure the following:\n(a) That their management body bears the ultimate responsibility for the oversight of the IRRBB management framework, the institution's risk appetite framework and the amounts, types and distribution of internal capital to adequately cover the risks. The management body should determine the institution's overall IRRBB strategy and approve the corresponding policies and processes. The management body may, however, delegate the monitoring and management of IRRBB to senior management, expert individuals or an asset and liability management committee under the conditions further specified in paragraph 42.\n(b) That they have in place an IRRBB management framework that establishes clear lines of responsibilities and that consists of a limit system, policies, processes and internal controls including regular independent reviews and evaluations of the effectiveness of the framework.\n(c) That the arrangements, processes and mechanisms referred for the assessment of IRRBB are comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent in the business model and the institution's activities.",
      "IRRBB: The management body should, in particular, be responsible for the following:\n(a) Understanding the nature and the level of the IRRBB exposure. The management body should ensure that there is clear guidance regarding the risk appetite for IRRBB in respect of the institution's business strategies.\n(b) Establishing that the appropriate actions are taken to identify, measure, monitor and control IRRBB, consistent with the approved strategies and policies. In this regard, the management body or its delegates are responsible for setting:\ni. appropriate limits on IRRBB, including the definition of specific procedures and approvals necessary for exceptions, and ensuring compliance with those limits;\nii. systems and standards for measuring IRRBB, valuing positions and assessing performance, including procedures for updating interest rate shocks, parameters and stress scenarios and key underlying assumptions driving the institution's IRRBB analysis;\niii. a comprehensive IRRBB reporting and review process; and\niv. effective internal controls and management information systems (MISs).\n(c) Approving major hedging or risk-taking initiatives in advance of implementation. Positions related to internal risk transfers between the non-trading book and the trading book should be properly documented.\n(d) Carrying out the oversight of the approval, implementation and review of IRRBB management policies, procedures and limits. The level of and changes in the institution's IRRBB exposure should be provided regularly to the management body (at least quarterly).\n(e) Ensuring that the validation of IRRBB measurement methods and assessment of corresponding model risk are included in a formal policy process that should be reviewed and approved by the management body or its delegates.\n(f) Understanding and assessing the functioning of its delegates in monitoring and controlling IRRBB, consistent with policies approved by the management body, on the basis of regular reviews of timely and sufficiently detailed information.\n(g) Understanding the implications of the institution's IRRBB strategies and their potential linkages with market, liquidity, credit and operational risk but without requiring all the management body members to be experts in the area. Some of the members should have sufficient technical knowledge to question and challenge the reports made to the management body. The institution should establish that management body members are responsible for ensuring that senior management has the competence to understand IRRBB and that IRRBB management is provided with adequate resources.",
      "IRRBB: Institutions should have delegation arrangements and procedures in place for any delegation by the management body of the monitoring or management of IRRBB, including, but not limited to, the following:\n(a) Persons or committees to which tasks of the management body are delegated for developing IRRBB policies and practices, such as senior management, expert individuals or an ALCO, should be identified and have objectives clearly set out by the management body.\n(b) The management body should ensure that there is an adequate separation of responsibilities in the risk management process for IRRBB. The IRRBB identification, measurement, monitoring and control functions should have clearly defined responsibilities, should be independent from risk-taking functions on IRRBB and should report IRRBB exposures directly to the management body or its delegates.\n(c) The institution should ensure that the management body's delegates have clear lines of authority over the units responsible for risk taking on IRRBB. The communication channel to convey the delegates' directives to these line units should be clear.\n(d) The management body should establish that the institution's structure enables its delegates to carry out their responsibilities, and facilitates effective decision-making and governance. In this regard an ALCO, or its equivalent, should meet regularly and its composition should reflect each major department linked to IRRBB. The management body should foster discussion regarding the IRRBB management process, both between the ALCO and the management body and between the ALCO and the line units. The ALCO should be able to challenge risk-taking activities and processes and should have the means to influence business decisions. Minutes of ALCO meetings should be retained, including a record of any dissent among the ALCO members.\n(e) The institution should provide the senior management and any expert individual or committee delegated by it with adequate resources to perform IRRBB tasks. In particular, any expert individual or committee delegated with IRRBB tasks should have the support of an operational unit or department which may provide further analysis on positions, assumptions and forecasts. This unit should also be entrusted with reporting on IRRBB to the management body or its delegates.",
      "IRRBB: Institutions should establish limits on the level of IRRBB exposures for both economic value and net interest income measures plus market value changes, in line with their risk appetite. These limits should be monitored regularly and should be approved by the management body or its delegates. Institutions should have procedures in place that describe the actions to be taken if limits are breached.",
      "IRRBB: Institutions should have policies and procedures in place for the management of IRRBB that are reviewed at least annually and approved by the management body or its delegates. The policies and procedures should cover all material aspects of IRRBB management, including the measurement systems, assumptions and modelling used for IRRBB identification, measurement, monitoring and control. They should specify:\n(a) the risk management strategies adopted by the institution for the management of IRRBB;\n(b) the specific responsibilities assigned to organisational units of the institution, or other participants in the IRRBB management process;\n(c) the measurement and modelling methods and assumptions used to identify, measure, monitor and control IRRBB, and their justifications;\n(d) the reporting lines for IRRBB-related information;\n(e) the required frequency and content of reports on IRRBB; and\n(f) the internal control and audit procedures to ensure the integrity of the IRRBB management process.",
      "IRRBB: Institutions should establish and maintain effective internal control systems and procedures to ensure compliance with the IRRBB management policies and limits. These should include:\n(a) independent reviews and evaluations of the effectiveness of the IRRBB management framework, including the policies, processes and systems in place for the management of IRRBB;\n(b) independent validation of the IRRBB measurement systems and models used for the management of IRRBB;\n(c) regular testing of the accuracy and reliability of data used in the IRRBB measurement systems; and\n(d) clear procedures for reporting and addressing any weaknesses in the IRRBB management framework."
